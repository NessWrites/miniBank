    Here, super().__init__(account_number, account_holder) ensures that savings.__account_number 
    and savings.__account_holder are properly initialized by the BankAccount class, while 
    self.interest_rate = interest_rate sets the interest rate specifically for the SavingsAccount class.
    
    When you create an instance of SavingsAccount, its __init__ method is called.
    
    super().__init__(account_number, account_holder) is used to initialize the attributes inherited from BankAccount.
    
	After the parent classâ€™s __init__ is called, the SavingsAccount class can initialize its own attributes, like interest_rate.
 
 
    When you create a SavingsAccount object, both the BankAccount and SavingsAccount constructors are executed, ensuring that the 
    object is fully initialized with all necessary attributes from both classes.
